  abstract = "The development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques
              has defined modern neuroimaging. Since its inception, tens of
              thousands of studies using techniques such as functional MRI and
              diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the non-invasive
              study of the brain. Despite the fact that MRI is routinely used
              to obtain data for neuroscience research, there has been no
              widely adopted standard for organizing and describing the data
              collected in an imaging experiment. This renders sharing and
              reusing data (within or between labs) difficult if not impossible
              and unnecessarily complicates the application of automatic
              pipelines and quality assurance protocols. To solve this problem,
              we have developed the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a
              standard for organizing and describing MRI datasets. The BIDS
              standard uses file formats compatible with existing software,
              unifies the majority of practices already common in the field,
              and captures the metadata necessary for most common data
              processing operations.",

              endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer

              as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of
              their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on
              the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on
              enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use
              the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals.
              This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR
              Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some
              exemplar implementations in the community.",

              (BTS), endeavours where a comparatively large number of

              pursuit of a common goal. Despite this burgeoning interest, there
              exists little guidance on how to create, manage and participate

              from a multi-disciplinary set of BTS initiatives to provide a
              how-to guide for BTS. We first discuss initial considerations for
              launching a BTS project, such as building the team, identifying
              leadership, governance, tools and open science approaches. We
              then turn to issues related to running and completing a BTS
              project, such as study design, ethical approvals and issues
              related to data collection, management and analysis. Finally, we
              address topics that present special challenges for BTS, including
              authorship decisions, collaborative writing and team
              decision-making.",
