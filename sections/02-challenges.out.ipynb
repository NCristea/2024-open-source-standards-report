    "# Opportunities and risks for open-source standards\n",
    "\n",
    "Data and metadata standards that adopt tools and practices of OSS (“open-source standards” henceforth) stand to reap many of the benefits that the OSS model has provided in the development of other technologies. At the same time, these tools and practices are associated with risks that need to be mitigated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Flexibility vs. stability\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the defining characteristics of OSS is its dynamism and its rapid evolution. Because OSS can be used by anyone and, in most cases, contributions can be made by anyone, innovations flow into OSS in a bottom-up fashion from user/developers. Pathways to contribution by members of the community are often well-defined: both from the technical perspective (e.g., through a pull request on GitHub, or other similar mechanisms), as well as from the social perspective (e.g., whether contributors need to accept certain licensing conditions through a contributor licensing agreement) and the socio-technical perspective (e.g., how many people need to review a contribution, what are the timelines for a contribution to be reviewed and accepted, what are the release cycles of the software that make the contribution available to a broader community of users, etc.). Similarly, open-source standards may also find themselves addressing use cases and solutions that were not originally envisioned through bottom-up contributions of members of a research community to which the standard pertains. However, while this dynamism provides an avenue for flexibility it also presents a source of tension. This is because data and metadata standards apply to already existing datasets, and changes may affect the compliance of these existing datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mismatches between standards developers and user communities\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an inherent gap in both interest and ability to engage with the technical details undergirding standards and their development between the core developers of the standard and their users. In extreme cases, these interests may even be at odds, as developers implement sophisticated mechanisms to automate the creation of the standard or advocate for more technically advanced mechanisms for evolving the standard, leaving potential users sidelined in the development of the standard, and limiting their ability to provide feedback about the practical implications of changes to the standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unclear pathways for standards success\n",
    "\n",
    "Standards typically develop organically through sustained and persistent efforts from dedicated groups of data practitioneers. These include scientists and the broader ecosystem of data curators and users. However there is no playbook on the structure and components of a data standard, or the pathway that moves a data implementation to a data standard. As a result, data standardization lacks formal avenues for research grants.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cross domain funding gaps\n",
    "\n",
    "Data standardization investment is justified if the standard is generalizable beyond any specific science domain. However while the use cases are domain sciences based, data standardization is seen as a data infrastructure and not a science investment. Moreover due to how science research funding works, scientists lack incentives to work across domains, or work on infrastructure problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data instrumentation issues\n",
    "\n",
    "Data for scientific observations are often generated by proprietary instrumentation due to commercialization or other profit driven incentives. There islack of regulatory oversight to adhere to available standards or evolve Significant data transformation is required to get data to a state that is amenable to standards, if available. If not available, there is lack of incentive to set aside investment or resources to invest in establishing data standards.\n",
