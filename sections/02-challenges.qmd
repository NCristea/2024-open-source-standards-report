# Challenges for open source data and metadata standards, and some solutions

## Too much flexibility, or too little

It's a story as old as time (or at least as old as standards): users fail to
consider existing standards, or perceive an existing standard as not offering
enough flexibility to cover some use case, and they embark on the development
of a new standard [^1].

[^1]: So old in fact that an oft-cited [XKCD comic](https://xkcd.com/927/) has
been devoted to it.

Another failure is the mismatch between developers of the standard and users.

## Sustainability

## The importance of automated validation
