# Challenges for open source data and metadata standards, and some solutions

## Too much flexibility, or too little

It's a story as old as time (or at least as old as standards): users fail to
consider existing standards, or perceive an existing standard as not offering
enough flexibility to cover some use case, and they embark on the development
of a new standard [^1].

[^1]: So old in fact that an oft-cited [XKCD comic](https://xkcd.com/927/) has
been devoted to it.

Another failure is the mismatch between developers of the standard and users.
There is an iherent gap in both interest and ability to engage with the
technical details undergirding standards and their development between the
developers of the standard and their users. In extreme cases, these interests
may be at odds, as developers implement sophisticated mechanisms to automate
the creation of the standard or advocate for more technically advanced
mechanisms for evolving the standard, leaving potential users sidelined in the
development of the standard, and limiting their ability to provide feedback
about the practical implications of changes to the standards.
