# Use cases

Meanwhile, the importance of standards is also increasingly understood in
research communities that are learning about the value of shared data
resources. While some fields, such as astronomy, high-energy physics and earth
sciences have a relatively long history of shared data resources from
organizations such as LSST and CERN, other fields have only relatively recently
become aware of the value of data sharing and its impact.

For example, neuroscience has traditionally been a "cottage industry", where
individual labs have generated experimental data designed to answer specific
experimental questions. While this model still exists, the field has also seen
the emergence of new modes of data production that focus on generating large
shared datasets designed to answer many different questions, more akin to the
data generated in large astronomy data collection efforts. This change has been
brought on through a combination of technical advances in data acquisition
techniques, which now generate large and very high-dimensional/information-rich
datasets, cultural changes, which have ushered in new norms of transparency and
reproducibility (related to the policy discussions mentioned above), and
funding initiatives that have encouraged this kind of data collection
(including the US BRAIN Initiative and the Allen Institute for Brain Science).
Neuroscience presents an interesting example, because in response to these new
data resources, the field has had to establish new standards for data and
metadata that facilitate sharing and using of these data. Two examples are the
Neurodata Without Borders file format for neurophysiology data [@Rubel2022NWB]
and the Brain Imaging Data Structure standard for neuroimaging data
[@Gorgolewski2016BIDS].
