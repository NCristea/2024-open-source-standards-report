    "The importance of standards stems not only from discussions within research fields about how research can best be conducted to take advantage of existing and growing datasets, but also arises from interactions with other sectors.\n",

    "For example, an ongoing series of policy discussions that address the interactions between research communities and the general public. In the United States, these policies are expressed, for example, in memos issued by the directors of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), James Holdren (in 2013) and Alondra Nelson (in 2022). While these memos focused primarily on making peer-reviewed publications funded by the US Federal government available to the general public, they also lay an increasingly detailed path toward the publication and general availability of the data that is collected in research that is funded by the US government. The general guidance and overall spirit of these memos dovetail with more specific policy guidance related to data and metadata standards. For example, the importance of standards was underscored in a recent report by the Subcommittee on Open Science of the National Science and Technology Council on the “Desirable characteristics of data repositories for federally funded research” \\[@nstc2022desirable\\]. The report explicitly called out the importance of “allow\\[ing\\] datasets and metadata to be accessed, downloaded, or exported from the repository in widely used, preferably non-proprietary, formats consistent with standards used in the disciplines the repository serves.” This highlights the need for data and metadata standards across a variety of different kinds of data. In addition, a report from the National Institute of Standards and Technology on “U.S. Leadership in AI: A Plan for Federal Engagement in Developing Technical Standards and Related Tools” emphasized that – specifically for the case of AI – “U.S. government agencies should prioritize AI standards efforts that are \\[…\\] Consensus-based, \\[…\\] Inclusive and accessible, \\[…\\] Multi-path, \\[…\\] Open and transparent, \\[…\\] and \\[that\\] result in globally relevant and non-discriminatory standards…” \\[@NIST2019\\]. The converging characteristics of standards that arise from these reports suggest that considerable thought needs to be given to how standards arise so that these goals are achieved."
