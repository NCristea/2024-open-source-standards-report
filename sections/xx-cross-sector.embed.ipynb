    "# Cross-sector interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of standards stems not only from discussions within research fields about how research can best be conducted to take advantage of existing and growing datasets, but also arises from interactions with other sectors. Several different kinds of cross-sector interactions can be defined as having important impact on the development of open-source standards.\n",

    "## Governmental policy-setting\n",
    "\n",
    "The development of open practices in research has entailed an ongoing interaction and dialogue with various governmental bodies that set policies for research. For example, for research that is funded by the public, this entails an ongoing series of policy discussions that address the interactions between research communities and the general public. One way in which this manifests in the United States specifically is in memos issued by the directors of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), James Holdren (in 1) and Alondra Nelson (in 2022). While these memos focused primarily on making peer-reviewed publications funded by the US Federal government available to the general public, they also lay an increasingly detailed path toward the publication and general availability of the data that is collected in research that is funded by the US government. The general guidance and overall spirit of these memos dovetail with more specific policy guidance related to data and metadata standards. For example, the importance of standards was underscored in a recent report by the Subcommittee on Open Science of the National Science and Technology Council on the “Desirable characteristics of data repositories for federally funded research” \\[@nstc2022desirable\\]. The report explicitly called out the importance of “allow\\[ing\\] datasets and metadata to be accessed, downloaded, or exported from the repository in widely used, preferably non-proprietary, formats consistent with standards used in the disciplines the repository serves.” This highlights the need for data and metadata standards across a variety of different kinds of data. In addition, a report from the National Institute of Standards and Technology on “U.S. Leadership in AI: A Plan for Federal Engagement in Developing Technical Standards and Related Tools” emphasized that – specifically for the case of AI – “U.S. government agencies should prioritize AI standards efforts that are \\[…\\] Consensus-based, \\[…\\] Inclusive and accessible, \\[…\\] Multi-path, \\[…\\] Open and transparent, \\[…\\] and \\[that\\] result in globally relevant and non-discriminatory standards…” \\[@NIST2019\\]. The converging characteristics of standards that arise from these reports suggest that considerable thought needs to be given to how standards arise so that these goals are achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "A compelling road map towards implementation and adoption of community-developed standards is offered in a blog post authored by the Center for Open Science’s Brian Nosek, entitled “Strategy for Culture Change” \\[@Nosek2019CultureChange\\]. The core idea is that affecting a turn toward open science requires an alignment of not only incentives and values, but also technical infrastructure and user experience. A sociotechnical bridge between these pieces, which make adoption of standards possible, and maybe even easy, and the policy goals, arises from a community of practice that makes adoption of standards normative. Once all of these pieces are in place, making adoption of open science standards required becomes more straightforward and less onerous.\n",

    "## Funding\n",
    "\n",
    "While government-set policy is primarily directed towards research that is funded through governmental funding agencies, there are other ways in which funding relates to the development of open-source standards. One way is in funding the development of these standards. For example, the National Institutes of Health have provided some of the funding for the development of the Brain Imaging Data Structure standard in neuroscience."
