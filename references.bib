              has defined modern neuroimaging. Since its inception, tens of
              thousands of studies using techniques such as functional MRI and
              diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the non-invasive
              study of the brain. Despite the fact that MRI is routinely used
              to obtain data for neuroscience research, there has been no
              widely adopted standard for organizing and describing the data
              collected in an imaging experiment. This renders sharing and
              reusing data (within or between labs) difficult if not impossible
              and unnecessarily complicates the application of automatic
              pipelines and quality assurance protocols. To solve this problem,
              we have developed the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a
              standard for organizing and describing MRI datasets. The BIDS
              standard uses file formats compatible with existing software,
              unifies the majority of practices already common in the field,
              and captures the metadata necessary for most common data
              processing operations.",

We focus on a specific sub-problem within a community's data sharing challenge and identify four major standards-based approaches to that task. We present characteristics of a data sharing community that one should consider in selecting a standards approach--such as relative power, motivation level, and technical sophistication of different participants--and illustrate with real-world examples. These characteristics and other factors are then analyzed to develop decision rules for selecting among the four approaches. Independent of the data exchange problem, we suggest two general practices in choosing a standards approach: (1) vertical decomposition of interoperability issues, in order to define a narrow, formal, tractable problem, and (2) option-exclusion rules, as they are much simpler than stating optimal-choice rules.},

These groups exhibit ideal characteristics for our purpose, as they form truly global networks working together over the Internet to develop next generation technologies. We first describe the software tools we developed to visualize the temporal communication flow, which represent communication patterns as directed acyclic graphs, We then show initial results, which revealed significant variations between the communication patterns and network structures of the different groups., We were also able to identify distinctive communication patterns among group leaders, both those who were officially appointed and other who were assuming unofficial coordinating roles.},

ABSTRACT = {All over the world, organizations are increasingly considering the adoption of open source software and open data. In the geospatial domain, this is no different, and the last few decades have seen significant advances in this regard. We review the current state of open source geospatial software, focusing on the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo) software ecosystem and its communities, as well as three kinds of open geospatial data (collaboratively contributed, authoritative and scientific). The current state confirms that openness has changed the way in which geospatial data are collected, processed, analyzed, and visualized. A perspective on future developments, informed by responses from professionals in key organizations in the global geospatial community, suggests that open source geospatial software and open geospatial data are likely to have an even more profound impact in the future.},

              reproducibility and maximize the impact of public investments in

              Initiative data archive that provides the ability to openly share
              data from a broad range of brain imaging data types following the
              FAIR principles for data sharing. We highlight the importance of
              the Brain Imaging Data Structure standard for enabling effective
              curation, sharing, and reuse of data. The archive presently
              shares more than 600 datasets including data from more than
              20,000 participants, comprising multiple species and measurement
              modalities and a broad range of phenotypes. The impact of the
              shared data is evident in a growing number of published reuses,
              currently totalling more than 150 publications. We conclude by
              describing plans for future development and integration with
              other ongoing open science efforts.",

  abstract  = "The rate of progress in human neurosciences is limited by the
               inability to easily apply a wide range of analysis methods to
               the plethora of different datasets acquired in labs around the
               world. In this work, we introduce a framework for creating,
               testing, versioning and archiving portable applications for
               analyzing neuroimaging data organized and described in
               compliance with the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS). The
               portability of these applications (BIDS Apps) is achieved by
               using container technologies that encapsulate all binary and
               other dependencies in one convenient package. BIDS Apps run on
               all three major operating systems with no need for complex setup
               and configuration and thanks to the comprehensiveness of the
               BIDS standard they require little manual user input. Previous
               containerized data processing solutions were limited to single
               user environments and not compatible with most multi-tenant High
               Performance Computing systems. BIDS Apps overcome this
               limitation by taking advantage of the Singularity container
               technology. As a proof of concept, this work is accompanied by
               22 ready to use BIDS Apps, packaging a diverse set of commonly

                   past 30 years by advancing standardization and tool
                   development to support rigor and transparency. Consequently,
                   the complexity of the data pipeline has also increased,

                   to reduce these burdens and democratize modern neuroscience
                   research across institutions and career levels. Using
                   community software and hardware infrastructure, the platform
                   provides open-source data standardization, management,
                   visualization, and processing and simplifies the data
                   pipeline. brainlife.io automatically tracks the provenance
                   history of thousands of data objects, supporting simplicity,
                   efficiency, and transparency in neuroscience research. Here

Prediscovery images from 2001, 2002, and 2003 have allowed us to refine the orbit sufficiently to conclude that Sedna is on a highly eccentric orbit that permanently resides well beyond the Kuiper Belt with a semimajor axis of 480 ± 40 AU and a perihelion of 76 ± 4 AU. Such an orbit is unexpected in our current understanding of the solar system but could be the result of scattering by a yet-to-be-discovered planet, perturbation by an anomalously close stellar encounter, or formation of the solar system within a cluster of stars. In all of these cases a significant additional population is likely present, and in the two most likely cases Sedna is best considered a member of the inner Oort Cloud, which then extends to much smaller semimajor axes than previously expected. Continued discovery and orbital characterization of objects in this inner Oort Cloud will verify the genesis of this unexpected population.}

abstract={Planetary formation theories1, 2 suggest that the giant planets formed on circular and coplanar orbits. The eccentricities of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus, however, reach values of 6 per cent, 9 per cent and 8 per cent, respectively. In addition, the inclinations of the orbital planes of Saturn, Uranus and Neptune take maximum values of approximately 2 degrees with respect to the mean orbital plane of Jupiter. Existing models for the excitation of the eccentricity of extrasolar giant planets3, 4, 5 have not been successfully applied to the Solar System. Here we show that a planetary system with initial quasi-circular, coplanar orbits would have evolved to the current orbital configuration, provided that Jupiter and Saturn crossed their 1:2 orbital resonance. We show that this resonance crossing could have occurred as the giant planets migrated owing to their interaction with a disk of planetesimals6, 7. Our model reproduces all the important characteristics of the giant planets' orbits, namely their final semimajor axes, eccentricities and mutual inclinations. PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

    abstract = { ▪ Abstract The Kuiper Belt consists of a large number of small, solid bodies in heliocentric orbit beyond Neptune. Discovered as recently as 1992, the Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) are thought to hold the keys to understanding the early solar system, as well as the origin of outer solar system objects, such as the short-period comets and the Pluto-Charon binary. The KBOs are probably best viewed as aged relics of the Sun's accretion disk. Dynamical structures in the Kuiper Belt provide evidence for processes operative in the earliest days of the solar system, including a phase of planetary migration and a clearing phase, in which substantial mass was lost from the disk. Dust is produced to this day by collisions between KBOs. In its youth, the Kuiper Belt may have compared to the dust rings observed now around such stars as GG Tau and HR 4796A. This review presents the basic physical parameters of the KBOs and makes connections with the disks observed around nearby stars. }

	abstract = {We introduce a new computational technique for searching for faint moving sources in astronomical images. Starting from a maximum-likelihood estimate for the probability of the detection of a source within a series of images, we develop a massively parallel algorithm for searching through candidate asteroid trajectories that utilizes graphics processing units (GPU). This technique can search over 1010 possible asteroid trajectories in stacks of the order of 10–15 4K × 4K images in under a minute using a single consumer grade GPU. We apply this algorithm to data from the 2015 campaign of the High Cadence Transient Survey (HiTS) obtained with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam). We find 39 previously unknown Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) in the 150 square degrees of the survey. Comparing these asteroids to an existing model for the inclination distribution of the Kuiper belt we demonstrate that we recover a KBO population above our detection limit consistent with previous studies. Software used in this analysis is made available as an open source package.}

abstract={The classical filtering and prediction problem is re-examined using the Bode-Shannon representation of random processes and the "state-transition" method of analysis of dynamic systems. New results are: (1) The formulation and methods of solution of the problem apply without modification to stationary and nonstationary statistics and to growing-memory and infinite-memory filters. (2) A nonlinear difference (or differential) equation is derived for the covariance matrix of the optimal estimation error. From the solution of this equation the co-efficients of the difference (or differential) equation of the optimal linear filter are obtained without further calculations. (3) The filtering problem is shown to be the dual of the noise-free regulator problem. The new method developed here is applied to two well-known problems, confirming and extending earlier results. The discussion is largely self-contained and proceeds from first principles; basic concepts of the theory of random processes are reviewed in the Appendix.},

    abstract = "{Efficient identification and follow-up of astronomical transients is hindered by the need for humans to manually select promising candidates from data streams that contain many false positives. These artefacts arise in the difference images that are produced by most major ground-based time-domain surveys with large format CCD cameras. This dependence on humans to reject bogus detections is unsustainable for next generation all-sky surveys and significant effort is now being invested to solve the problem computationally. In this paper, we explore a simple machine learning approach to real–bogus classification by constructing a training set from the image data of ∼32 000 real astrophysical transients and bogus detections from the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey. We derive our feature representation from the pixel intensity values of a 20 × 20 pixel stamp around the centre of the candidates. This differs from previous work in that it works directly on the pixels rather than catalogued domain knowledge for feature design or selection. Three machine learning algorithms are trained (artificial neural networks, support vector machines and random forests) and their performances are tested on a held-out subset of 25 per cent of the training data. We find the best results from the random forest classifier and demonstrate that by accepting a false positive rate of 1 per cent, the classifier initially suggests a missed detection rate of around 10 per cent. However, we also find that a combination of bright star variability, nuclear transients and uncertainty in human labelling means that our best estimate of the missed detection rate is approximately 6 per cent.}",

We describe here various machine learning (ML) implementations and plans to make the maximal use of the large data set by taking advantage of the temporal nature of the data, and further combining it with other data sets. We start with the initial steps of separating bogus candidates from real ones, separating stars and galaxies, and go on to the classification of real objects into various classes. Besides the usual methods (e.g., based on features extracted from light curves) we also describe early plans for alternate methods including the use of domain adaptation, and deep learning. In a similar fashion we describe efforts to detect fast moving asteroids. We also describe the use of the Zooniverse platform for helping with classifications through the creation of training samples, and active learning. Finally we mention the synergistic aspects of ZTF and LSST from the ML perspective.}

ABSTRACT = {The Google Earth Engine (GEE) portal provides enhanced opportunities for undertaking earth observation studies. Established towards the end of 2010, it provides access to satellite and other ancillary data, cloud computing, and algorithms for processing large amounts of data with relative ease. However, the uptake and usage of the opportunity remains varied and unclear. This study was undertaken to investigate the usage patterns of the Google Earth Engine platform and whether researchers in developing countries were making use of the opportunity. Analysis of published literature showed that a total of 300 journal papers were published between 2011 and June 2017 that used GEE in their research, spread across 158 journals. The highest number of papers were in the journal Remote Sensing, followed by Remote Sensing of Environment. There were also a number of papers in premium journals such as Nature and Science. The application areas were quite varied, ranging from forest and vegetation studies to medical fields such as malaria. Landsat was the most widely used dataset; it is the biggest component of the GEE data portal, with data from the first to the current Landsat series available for use and download. Examination of data also showed that the usage was dominated by institutions based in developed nations, with study sites mainly in developed nations. There were very few studies originating from institutions based in less developed nations and those that targeted less developed nations, particularly in the African continent.},

ABSTRACT = {The traditional flow of coastal ocean model data is from High-Performance Computing (HPC) centers to the local desktop, or to a file server where just the needed data can be extracted via services such as OPeNDAP. Analysis and visualization are then conducted using local hardware and software. This requires moving large amounts of data across the internet as well as acquiring and maintaining local hardware, software, and support personnel. Further, as data sets increase in size, the traditional workflow may not be scalable. Alternatively, recent advances make it possible to move data from HPC to the Cloud and perform interactive, scalable, data-proximate analysis and visualization, with simply a web browser user interface. We use the framework advanced by the NSF-funded Pangeo project, a free, open-source Python system which provides multi-user login via JupyterHub and parallel analysis via Dask, both running in Docker containers orchestrated by Kubernetes. Data are stored in the Zarr format, a Cloud-friendly n-dimensional array format that allows performant extraction of data by anyone without relying on data services like OPeNDAP. Interactive visual exploration of data on complex, large model grids is made possible by new tools in the Python PyViz ecosystem, which can render maps at screen resolution, dynamically updating on pan and zoom operations. Two examples are given: (1) Calculating the maximum water level at each grid cell from a 53-GB, 720-time-step, 9-million-node triangular mesh ADCIRC simulation of Hurricane Ike; (2) Creating a dashboard for visualizing data from a curvilinear orthogonal COAWST/ROMS forecast model.},

	abstract = {High-resolution galaxy spectra contain much information about galactic physics, but the high dimensionality of these spectra makes it difficult to fully utilize the information they contain. We apply variational autoencoders (VAEs), a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique, to a sample of spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). In contrast to principal component analysis (PCA), a widely used technique, VAEs can capture nonlinear relationships between latent parameters and the data. We find that a VAE can reconstruct the SDSS spectra well with only six latent parameters, outperforming PCA with the same number of components. Different galaxy classes are naturally separated in this latent space, without class labels having been given to the VAE. The VAE latent space is interpretable because the VAE can be used to make synthetic spectra at any point in latent space. For example, making synthetic spectra along tracks in latent space yields sequences of realistic spectra that interpolate between two different types of galaxies. Using the latent space to find outliers may yield interesting spectra: in our small sample, we immediately find unusual data artifacts and stars misclassified as galaxies. In this exploratory work, we show that VAEs create compact, interpretable latent spaces that capture nonlinear features of the data. While a VAE takes substantial time to train (≈1 day for 48,000 spectra), once trained, VAEs can enable the fast exploration of large astronomical data sets.}
